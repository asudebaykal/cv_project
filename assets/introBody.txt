Automated vehicle detection is extremely important for autonomous driving and road management tasks. Vehicle detection systems can reduce the accident rate further since humans may lose focus when driving and may have mis-operation during bad road conditions. For example, front collision warning and passive side impact protection can be developed if the cameras can detect the cars that are approaching. Driver\'92s pressure during long distance trips can be reduced by adaptive cruise control with a car following system. Even though there might be a long way to achieve fully automated vehicles, the amount of accidents caused by human error will be reduced by vehicle detection systems.
